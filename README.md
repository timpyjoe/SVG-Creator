# SVG Creator

## Description

This project is a simple CLI program that will a little bit of user input, and use it to create a simple logo in the form of an SVG file. It served as a way for me to become more comfortable using multiple aspects of object-oriented programming. It also helped me learn how to use things like constructors, unit testing with Jest, command line prompts with Inquirer, and custom error messages. 


## Usage

To use this program you must first clone the repo down to your local machine. Then navigate to the Develop folder and open it using the integrated terminal. While in the terminal, run 'node index.js' and answer the questions that are prompted to you. Once all questions have been answered, the inputs will be used to created an SVG file (logo.svg) with the desired logo.
